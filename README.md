# MBv3's-What-Would-Twitter-Do
A Python script to perform sentiment analysis, and so much more, for a user-prompted Twitter handle.

What Would Twitter Do (Sentiment Analysis+)
======
**What Would Twitter Do** is a Twitter sentiment analysis tool. 
Yes, one of the hundreds. Why will this be different?

- Easy: Users need only the Twitter handle they want to analyze and their Twitter API credentials to run a quick SA
- Fast: No code needs to be modified to run the script
- Customizable: Multiple options for timeline, data visualization, etc. available through prompts

## Version Steps/Goals
* Finalize initial version with a quick, easy, user-prompted 'Analysis Overview'
* Add multiple plot/graph options
* Add multiple comparison options
* Add monitoring and notification features
* Incorporate scikit-learn for sentiment predictions
* Expand sentiment data sources (Reddit, RSS feeds, etc.)

## Download
* This is most definitely a Work in Progress... not even beta yet
* Download to test/inspect/modify/etc. only
* [twitcred_sample](https://github.com/MattyBv3/MBv3-What-Would-Twitter-Do/blob/master/twitcred_sample.py) must be modified to contain your personal Twitter API credentials until prompts are created in the primary script.
* [wwtd_v0.1.1](https://github.com/MattyBv3/MBv3-What-Would-Twitter-Do/blob/master/wwtd_v0.1.1.py) is the primary script.
